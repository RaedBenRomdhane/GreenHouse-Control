# Green Control System ðŸŒ¿

Welcome to the **Green Control System** repository! This project is designed to monitor and regulate greenhouse conditions, ensuring optimal environments for crops while minimizing energy consumption.

## Project Structure

This repository is divided into the following folders:

1. **Mobile App**: 
   A cross-platform app built with Expo, allowing users to monitor and adjust greenhouse thresholds, view real-time data, and receive alerts for extreme conditions.
   - ðŸ“‚ **[Mobile App Folder](./Mobile App)**
   - ðŸ“„ **[Mobile App README](./Mobile_App/README.md)**

2. **Server**: 
   A Dockerized server that connects the mobile app to two PCBs (internal and external), facilitating data exchange and decision-making for greenhouse control.
   - ðŸ“‚ **[Server Folder](./GreenControl Server)**
   - ðŸ“„ **[Server README](./Server/README.md)**

3. **ESP32 (Arduino Code) for Internal PCB**: 
   Code for the ESP32 microcontroller managing sensors and actuators in the greenhouse.
   - ðŸ“‚ **[ESP32 Folder](./Internal_PCB)**
   - ðŸ“„ **[ESP32 README](./Internal_PCB/README.md)**

3. **ESP32 (Arduino Code) for External PCB**: 
   Code for the ESP32 microcontroller managing sensors and actuators in the greenhouse.
   - ðŸ“‚ **[ESP32 Folder](./External_PCB)**
   - ðŸ“„ **[ESP32 README](./External_PCB/README.md)**

## How It Works

1. **Internal PCB**:
   - Collects data on temperature, humidity, air quality, and soil moisture within the greenhouse.
   - Actuates devices like fans, valves, heaters, and humidifiers based on thresholds.

2. **External PCB**:
   - Monitors external environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and air quality).
   - Shares data with the internal PCB to optimize ventilation and energy usage.

3. **Mobile App**:
   - Allows users to set thresholds, view real-time conditions, and receive alerts.

4. **Server**:
   - Facilitates communication between the mobile app and PCBs.
   - Manages MQTT messaging and data storage.
